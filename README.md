```
Once you're done with that save it as ota.xml and upload it to your host
and add it to your ro.ota.manifest="link here to your ota.xml" 

##Updates

Now that you have that done whenever you want to push update make sure to do this on ever update 

- look at your build.prop so that your version is incrementally higher than before

```
  # Before
  ro.candyroms.version=20150105
  
  # After
  ro.candyroms.version=20150108 
```
- Replace/overwrite your ota.xml with the candyversion number you saw in the zip

- Publish your ROM on your favourite website

Now all your users will get an OTA update notification at some point, whenever their device checks for one!
